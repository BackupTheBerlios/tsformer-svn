son2srt - a DVB subtitle converter script
=========================================

son2srt converts .son (DVDMaestro) bitmap subtitles to the text-based .srt
format. It can be used to process subtitle files generated with the ProjectX
DVB demuxing tool. With a good symbol database the number of errors can easily
be under 10 in a two-hour movie. However, corrupted subtitle images will cause
problems.

son2srt is currently not suitable for DVD subtitle conversion because subtitle
fonts are not universal. Building a symbol database for each disc would be a
tedious job without a good GUI (and frustrating even then). However, DVB
broadcasters (YLE in Finland) use only one font, which son2srt can handle
non-interactively with a complete symbol database.


Requirements
------------

- Python 2.3 or newer
- gocr 0.40 (0.39 may work almost as well)
- netpbm tools

son2srt should be usable on any platform with these programs installed,
but so far it has only been tested on Debian GNU/Linux and a Redhat variant.
On modern Linux distributions only gocr may need to be installed or updated.


Usage
-----

You can get complete instructions by running:
python son2srt.py --help

Also read yle_dvbsub/README for information about various OCR errors.


This package also includes a simple VDR recording to MPEG4 AVC + Ogg Vorbis +
SRT transcoding script in file vdr-x264.sh. The script should be fairly
self-documenting, so read it through to get an idea of what is going on.  It
requires some additional programs which are listed in the beginning of the
script. Edit the script parameters according to your needs. The VDR recordings
should be cut before transcoding.


About Project X
---------------

I've had a couple problems with Project X 0.82.1.02_b2. Firstly it seemed to
demux my VDR recordings very slowly (20h for a 2h recording on an Athlon64).
After some testing I found that this only happens if there are other
CPU-intensive processes running at the same time -- even if they are at much
lower priorities, niced to 19. I hunted the problem down to yield() calls in
X.java. Apparently they suspend the Project X process and allow the
lower-priority processes take much more CPU time. At least this is what happens
on J2SE 5.0 on Linux. After I commented all the yields out, Project X has been
working fine, without any side-effects.

I wrote about this to the Project X forum, but the developers probably won't do
anything about it unless more people have the same problem. So step up if you
encounter this issue.

Secondly Project X has a bug in decoding DVB subtitles with more than two lines
of text. Sometimes they come out just fine, and sometimes the lines get
overlapped. Of course, this completely destroys the OCR results. I might try to
solve the bug if I get too fed up with it, but don't count on it.


For advanced users and developers
---------------------------------

Gocr seems to work poorly on subtitles by default, but this can be fixed by
building a custom symbol database. Create a complete database for the subtitle
font with son2srt by supplying parameters -d and -a. Gocr will prompt for new
symbols, so just answer the questions patiently. After the database is
(mostly) complete, you can use it for other tasks non-interactively by
omitting the -a parameter. Gocr may be slow with a large database, but it
recognizes most characters and even italic fonts very well.

In sans-serif fonts "l" and "I" are usually almost exacly the same, in which
case you'll be best off using "l" even if gocr asks for the "I" symbol first.
The letters can be mostly corrected later with a simple filter.

Recent CVS version (July 2005) of gocr finds better matches for some symbols
than version 0.40, but it doesn't seem to care about the -s parameter at all.
Hopefully it will be fixed in version 0.41.
