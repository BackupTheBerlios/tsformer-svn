YLE DVB subtitle symbol database for son2srt
--------------------------------------------
Niko Mikkilä <mikkila at cs helsinki fi>

The database consists of db.lst, .pbm symbol bitmaps and a correction filter
in correct.py. db.lst connects bitmaps to their symbolic representation and
the filter is used in postprocessing to correct OCR errors.

The bitmap files are pieces of data captured from FTA YLE DVB broadcasts.
They are provided here for convenience.


Remaining problems
------------------

Annoying:

- "f" is recognized as "l" in italic fonts. Building generic filter rules for
  this is pretty hard, so gocr should handle it better. These are also hard
  to find manually without reading all the lines through.

- Subtitle corruption. Usually horizontal lines in the bitmaps which really
  confuse gocr. Search for "--" in the resulting srt file.

Mostly harmless:

- Dots after "ä" and "ö" letters. These can be mostly catched with filters, but
  some tough cases remain. To find the offenders manually, search for "ä.",
  "ö." and "b.". Gocr CVS fixes this (although causes more serious problems
  elsewhere).

- There are still some symbols missing from the database. When encountered,
  a new symbol can be added by cutting it out of the bmp file, inverting the
  colors, changing color space to black and white and converting the result to
  .pbm format with netpbm tools. Finally, a corresponding entry needs to be put
  to the db.lst file. 
  Alternatively you can try giving the -a parameter to son2srt, but then you'll
  probably need to answer a lot of redundant symbol queries too.
